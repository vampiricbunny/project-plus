## Note: this is ment to be run offline:

While this can be put online, it’s just standard HTML and some JavaScript. It’s meant to be run offline — it can be hosted locally or simply opened by double-clicking and running it in a browser. This is the project, along with the CompTIA 005 test, answers, and the study guide I used.
